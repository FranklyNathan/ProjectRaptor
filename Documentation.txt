**Characters**

Cyan Square
HP: 120 / AB: 4
J -- 3x2 melee attack in front. Careens 20.
K -- Melee attack that strikes with 2 pincers. Poisons.
L -- Teleports behind the nearest enemy square and strikes with a 1x1 attack. 2x Critical hit chance. Stuns.
Passive: Killing an enemy square resets AB
(Note: Cyan square is broken--who balanced this??)


Yellow Square
HP: 60 / AB: 5
J -- Fires a 1x1 projectile in a straight line that deals 20 damage. Only drops the AB by 2 instead of emptying it.
K -- Creates a 4x4 ripple 12 tiles away that deals 20 damage.
L -- Full screen paralysis. Paralyzed enemies are frozen in place for 8 seconds and their ABs recover at 1/2 speed.
Passive: All friendly squares have +10% critical hit chance.


Pink Square
HP: 100 / AB: 3
J -- Fires a 1x3 melee attack in a straight line.
K -- Fires a 3x2 heal. Heals for 50 HP.
L -- Giant Blue Refresh. All friendly squares in the zone have their ABs refilled
Passive: All friendly squares heal 3HP per second.


Striped Square
HP: 80 / AB: 4
J -- Causes a 3x1 tile attack to quickly spin around Striped Square, as though it were spinning a sword in a circle. For example, it starts by creating a 3x1 red-tile attack in front of it, and then that attack progresses to hit in all 8 directions. Deals 50 damage.
K -- Doesn't do damage, but pulls all enemy squares to be 1 tile away from stripedsquare, as if sucking them in with a magnet.
L -- For the next 3 seconds, all enemy attacks heal player colored squares instead of doing damage. They heal for the same damage they would have otherwise dealt.
Passive: All friendly squares take reduced damage while Striped Square is out. Allied squares take only 75% damage from enemy attacks.


Orange Square
HP: 100 / AB 5
J -- Creates one 10-damage ripple size 3 every second to a random location. A new kind of attack called a Continuous. After pressing the attack key to use a continuous attack, the continuous attack will continue happening on the screen over and over. A continuous attack only stops when the square that used the attack presses its attack button a 2nd time, or if the attacking square dies. The AB empties as usual when a continuous attack is first selected. However, during a continuous attack, the AB does not fill. 

K -- An attack that does 40 damage. This attack creates a red beam that briefly connects each playable square (forming a triangle since there are 3 colored squares. The red beam is about 2 tiles thick. Any enemy hit by any of the three beams takes damage).

L -- A dash that does not damage. Orange square dashes forward in the direction it's moving 4 tiles. Many other units will get attacks that include dashes as part of how they work if that's relevant for structure. Only lowers AB by 1.

Passive: If the line that the comet that flies from character to character on when you change control passes through an enemy, that enemy takes 10 damage. 



**Status Effects**
Poison: Whiled poisoned, a square loses 4 health per second. Their model pulsates with a pink tint. Poison lasts forever until cured with an item or another move.

Stun: Stunned squares are frozen in place, cannot attack, and their ABs do not fill. They're tinted purple. 

Paralysis: Paralyzed squares are frozen in place, and their ABs fill at half speed (but can attack when it's full). They're tinted yellow.

Careen: A careening square is sent moving in the opposite direction from which it was hit. A careening square has a variable of "force" letting the game know how many tiles to send the square. A careening square with a force of 1 is sent back one square. A careening square with force 20 is sent back 20 squares. A careening square that hits the edge of the screen or another square on the same team stops. A careening square that hits an edge or another square causes a 3-tile ripple on the tile where it comes to a stop.
